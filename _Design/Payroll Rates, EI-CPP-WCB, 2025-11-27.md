# EI, CPP, and WCB Rates for Yukon Employers in 2025

_NOTE: AI generated so may not be entirely acturate._

**Child care employers in Yukon face combined payroll deduction rates of approximately 10-11% of wages** when accounting for Employment Insurance (EI), Canada Pension Plan (CPP/CPP2), and Workers' Compensation Board (WCB) contributions. While EI and CPP are federal programs with uniform rates across Canada, Yukon's WCB rates are territory-specific and notably favorable for 2025—all rate groups received decreases of 3.6% to 13.8%, with child care operations likely falling in the Services Low category at just **$0.77 per $100 of payroll**.

## Yukon WCB rates dropped significantly across all sectors

A **$10 million rebate** was also distributed to eligible employers—the sixth such rebate since 2015.

| Rate Group                        | 2025 Rate (per $100 payroll) | 2024 Rate | Change |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------- | ------ |

## Child care operations fall under favorable Services classification

Based on Yukon's four-sector classification system (Resources and Transportation, Construction, Services, and Government), child care and early learning programs fall within the **Services** sector. Child care aligns with NAICS Code 624410 (Child Day Care Services) under Health Care and Social Assistance. Given the nature of the work—primarily educational supervision and social services with lower physical hazard profiles—ELCC employers would most likely be classified as:

- **Services Low: $0.77 per $100 payroll** (most probable for child care)
- **Services Medium: $1.42 per $100 payroll** (possible depending on activities)

**Sample calculation for a child care center with $200,000 annual payroll at Services Low rate:**
($200,000 ÷ 100) × $0.77 = **$1,540 annual WCB premium**

**Important:** The exact sub-classification must be confirmed directly with WSCB during employer registration. Contact: 867-667-5645 or visit 401 Strickland Street, Whitehorse.

## Combined employer costs summary for ELCC operations

For a Yukon child care employer with employees earning at or below $65,700 annually, the combined employer payroll burden breaks down as:

| Deduction Type           | Employer Rate | Notes                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Employment Insurance     | 2.296%        | On first $65,700 of earnings     |
| Canada Pension Plan      | 5.95%         | On earnings $3,500–$71,300       |
| CPP2                     | 4.00%         | Only on earnings $71,300–$81,200 |
| Yukon WCB (Services Low) | 0.77%         | On first $104,975 of earnings    |
| **Total employer rate**  | **~9.0%**     | For employees under $65,700      |

For employees earning between the EI maximum ($65,700) and CPP maximum ($71,300), the effective total rate adjusts as EI contributions cap out while CPP continues.

## Conclusion

Yukon child care employers benefit from some of the lowest WCB rates in the territory at **$0.77 per $100 of payroll** under the Services Low classification, combined with federally standardized EI and CPP rates. The 2025 landscape shows marginal decreases in EI premiums, continued CPP enhancement at 5.95%, full implementation of CPP2 at 4%, and meaningful WCB reductions across all Yukon industries. For ELCC applications requiring precise rate documentation, the CRA sources provide authoritative federal rate confirmations while the WSCB announcement and rate sheets offer territory-specific assessment information. Employers should confirm their specific WCB classification directly with WSCB to ensure accurate payroll calculations.
