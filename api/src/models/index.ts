// I want to keep default exports to encourage the "single thing per file" principle
// you can still access the model bundle via import * as models from "@/models"
// but import models from "@/models" will be undefined
// Its not ideal, but it's hopefully the best of both worlds?
// Avoids leaking random last default export from model files
